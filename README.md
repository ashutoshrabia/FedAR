# fedAR+
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model to predict which home appliance is consuming power based on time series data. The project aims to classify power consumption patterns into one of five appliance categories.
#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the appliance category from power consumption data collected over time. The dataset includes multiple time-based features and power readings, enabling us to build a model that accounts for seasonal and daily usage patterns.

#Dataset
Source: https://github.com/areinhardt/tracebase/tree/master
Format: The dataset is in CSV format with the following key columns:
datetime: Date and time of the reading (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss).
info1 and info2: Power consumption readings from a smart plug.
Appliance label: Encoded as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, representing five distinct appliance categories.
Features: The dataset has additional engineered features like year, month, day, hour, hour_sin, hour_cos, day_of_week_sin, day_of_week_cos, along with lagged and rolling statistical features:
info1_lag_1, info2_lag_1: Lagged values for power readings.
info1_rolling_mean_3, info2_rolling_std_3: Rolling mean and standard deviation for window size 3.
Model and Training
Architecture: [Specify model type, e.g., a neural network, random forest, etc.]
Implementation: The model is implemented using [framework or libraries, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn].
Target Variable: Appliance label (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) representing distinct appliances.
Challenge: One class had significantly lower recall in the modelâ€™s predictions, indicating potential difficulty in accurately classifying it. This could be due to class imbalance or similar power consumption patterns.
Evaluation
Overall Accuracy: 86.54%
Classification Report:
Precision, recall, and F1-score are provided for each of the five classes.
High precision and recall for certain classes, but relatively lower recall for one specific class.
Macro Average: Precision - 0.86, Recall - 0.81, F1-score - 0.82
Weighted Average: Precision - 0.88, Recall - 0.87, F1-score - 0.87
This indicates the model is fairly robust, with good predictive power, but could improve further on certain classes.
